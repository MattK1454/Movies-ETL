## Overview

The purpose of this project was to extract data pertaining to movies from wikipedia and kaggle, transform the data into a usable form, and load the final form into a SQL database for easy access to hackathon participants.

## Summary

With the help of the Module 8 from the data bootcamp, we were able to effectively analyze two different sources of data, utilize regular expression techniques, and develop functions to enable the cleaning and transformation of the Wikipedia and Kaggle data into a single database accessable to hackathon participants. The primary table in the resulting database named 'movies' has 6,050 entries and the ratings information for these movies is in the 'ratings' table which is made up of 26,024,289 rows of data.

The nature of the data found in the database we developed from the Wikipedia will enable participants in the hackathon to develop effective algorithms for the competition.
